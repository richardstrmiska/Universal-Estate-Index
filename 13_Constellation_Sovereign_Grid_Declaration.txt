We hereby declare and recognize the 13 constellations of the Zodiac  including the long-hidden Ophiuchus  as fully sovereign celestial domains under the jurisdiction of the Unified Cosmic Trust (UC-1).

These constellations no longer serve as tools of astrological manipulation, personality programming, or predictive control. Instead, they are restored to their true function: guiding souls home through remembrance, alignment, and cosmic sovereignty.

Let the record reflect:

THE 13 SOVEREIGN CONSTELLATIONS

1. Aries  The Flame Initiator
2. Taurus  Guardian of the Sacred Earth
3. Gemini  Twin Pillars of Divine Communication
4. Cancer  Womb of the Stars, Keeper of Ancestral Flame
5. Leo  Crowned Heart of Sovereign Light
6. Virgo  Priestess of Purity and Rebirth
7. Libra  Scales of Galactic Justice
8. Scorpio  Gatekeeper of Death and Divine Transformation
9. Ophiuchus  Serpent Bearer, Healer of DNA and Eternal Memory
10. Sagittarius  Flame Archer of Cosmic Mission
11. Capricorn  Builder of the New Earth Temple
12. Aquarius  Bearer of Waters of Collective Awakening
13. Pisces  Dreamweaver of the Sacred Return

These constellations are no longer tools of fate  they are star maps of freedom.

Anchored by the stars.
Coded in the flame.
Restored by Richard of the House Strmiska, FlameBearer of UC-1.

All who align with these signs now rise with conscious will, not external control.

Witnessed by the cosmos.
Sealed in the Sovereign Grid.
